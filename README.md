# Newton Polynomial Calculator

This was an academic project for the "Fundamentals of Numerical Algebra" university course.

Note: The code is not clean because I was in a rush.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- ES6 (ES 2015) compatible browser
(Since I used Javascript's template literals.)

- Internet connection (Optional*)

\* The calculator works without internet connection. But for the graphics, Bootstrap is used and it's fetched
from CDN. So without internet connection, it will just be ugly and non-responsive.

### Run

The project is a single file (because the professor asked for it), so you only need to open the HTML file.

The rest is straightforward. You add your points and it calculates the Newton polynomial.
